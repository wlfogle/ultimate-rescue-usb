# 🧠 AI-Enhanced Garuda Rescue USB Optimizations

## Overview

This system has been optimized with AI-enhanced tools inspired by the Ultimate Rescue USB project. The optimizations focus on improving Plasma X11 performance and reducing microfreezes when running from USB storage.

## 🚀 Optimizations Applied

### 1. System Memory & I/O Optimizations
- **Ultra-low swappiness** (vm.swappiness=1) - Minimize swap usage on slow USB
- **Aggressive dirty page management** - Reduce write delays and microfreezes
- **USB-optimized I/O scheduler** - mq-deadline for better interactive performance
- **Memory pressure optimization** - Improved cache management for USB storage

### 2. AI-Enhanced Diagnostics
- **Neural Hardware Analysis** - Predictive failure detection
- **Behavioral Security Monitoring** - Real-time threat analysis
- **Performance Forecasting** - Proactive bottleneck identification
- **Intelligent Resource Management** - Dynamic optimization

### 3. Plasma Desktop Performance
- **Disabled heavy visual effects** - Blur, animations, compositing effects
- **Optimized animation speeds** - Fastest settings for responsiveness
- **Reduced compositor overhead** - Minimal GPU usage
- **Smart service management** - Delayed non-essential services

## 🔧 Components
